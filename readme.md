# My Vite Project

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool for a fast and optimized development experience.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (preferably the latest LTS version).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone 
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server and you can view your application by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist` directory. You can serve this directory using any static file server or deploy it to your hosting provider.

## Previewing the Production Build

You can preview the production build locally to ensure it works as expected:

```sh
npm run preview
```

This will serve the contents of the `dist` directory on a local server.

## Scripts

Here are the scripts available in this project:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the application for production.
- **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally.
